title: Road to V3
---
I have always been someone that has been very independent. Though I've always had a full time job and done contracting on the side.
But that has all changed, today was my last day working for Capax Discovery. The Capax companies have been good to me for that last three years, but the time came for me to part ways.
With that I have started my own company [V3 LLC](http://v3.io). Some of you may recognize that name, it was a name of a product that never was finished, then became a podcast with [@ws](https://twitter.com/ws) and now its my company. For now its just me, but I have plans to grow as time goes on.
I plan to post learnings from running my own company, I've already learned a lot and its only been a few weeks.

I am focusing on my deep knowledge of Office 365 and Azure. For now I am working on migrations and greenfield deployment in Azure, so Virtual Networks, Virtual Machines, Azure AD, Azure AD Connect, Exchange Online.
