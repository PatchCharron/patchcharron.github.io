My name is Patch Charron. I have been in the IT industry for 10+ years doing everything from infrastructure support, IT leadership, software development, and to today running a small IT consulting group focusing on Azure and Microsoft technologies.

4 years ago I left a great job working as the Director of Platform Engineering for a software company to head out on my own, it has been an interesting adventure filled with learning, successes and struggles. Though this blog will mostly be a spot to talk about not well covered things in Azure, as a way to pay-it-forward as so many others have done for me, I am also passionate about helping others that want to be independant and start their own companies.
